# Tax-Fraud-Detection-in-NYC-Real-Estate

# Introduction
This project is from one of my classes from USC Marshall School of Business, DSO 562 - Fraud Analytics. It is an unsupervised machine learning application where we were told to identify the outliers (potential fraudesters) in the NYC Property valuation datatset who follow wrong practices in property tax filing. Principal component analysis, Z-score, and Autoencoder were used to solve the problem post data imputatuon and feature engineering.
