# Tax-Fraud-Detection-in-NYC-Real-Estate

# Introduction
This project is from one of my classes from USC Marshall School of Business, DSO 562 - Fraud Analytics. It is an unsupervised machine learning application where we identified the outliers (potential fraudesters) in NYC Property valuation datatset. Principal component analysis, Z-score, and Autoencoder methodologies were used to solve the problem after performing data imputatuon and feature engineering.
